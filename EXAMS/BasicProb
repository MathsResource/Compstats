\item[(e)]\textbf{\textit{Independent Events (4 Marks)}}\\ Suppose A and B are two events, with P(A), the probability that A occurs, equal to 0.4 and P(B), the probability that B occurs, equal to 0.5. You may assume that A and B are independent events.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Calculate P(A $\cap$ B), the probability of both A and B occuring. %if A and B are independent events.
\item[(b)]  Calculate P(A $\cup$ B), the probability of either A or B (or both) occuring.
%\item[i]               A and B are mutually exclusive events
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}




\subsection*{Part E : Probability Laws}
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(A \cap B)  = P(A) \times P(B) = 0.5\times 0.4 = 0.2 $
\item $P(A \cup B)  = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.7$
\end{itemize}
