\item[(d)] \textbf{\textit{Poisson Approximation of the Binomial Distribution }}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Describe how the Poisson distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution.
\item[(b)] (1 Mark) Explain the circumstances in which this approximation may be used in preference to the binomial distribution.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}




\subsection*{Part D : Poisson Approximation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bin(n,p)
\item Poisson(m)
\item Appropropriate when n is greater than 50 and p is less than 0.05.
\item Let $m = np$ and compute as poisson distribution.
\item For large values of n and really small vaues of p, Poisson Approximation is much simpler computationally, with negligible error.
\end{itemize}
