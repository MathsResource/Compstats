\large
\[ TS = \frac{8800 - 9000}{158.11} \]
\begin{itemize}
\item The test statistic $TS = -1.265$
\item The CV is determined with $\alpha = 0.05$ and $k = 2$ (column = $\alpha/k=0.025$).
\item The sample is small n = 10 $df = n-1 = 9$ (i.e. row =9).
\item Therefore $CV = 2.262$

\item (Remark: If the sample was large, we could use $CV = 1.96$).

\end{itemize}
