\begin{itemize}
\item As the sample was large, we could use $CV = 1.96$ (as always, two tailed procedure, with $\alpha=0.05$).

\item \textbf{Decision Rule}: Is the $TS > CV$ ? \\  Is $2.65 > 1.96$ ? - Yes , we reject the null hypothesis.
\item There is enough evidence to suggest that there is a difference in drug treatments.
\end{itemize}
