% New Question On Binomial

\item[(b)] \textbf{\textit{Probability Distributions (8 Marks)}}\\
For a digital communication channel, the probability of a bit being received in error is $5\%$. Consider the case where 100 bits are transmitted. Answer the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] 	What is the probability that the number of bits received in error is 5?
\item[(b)]  What is the probability that the number of bits received in error is greater than 10?
\item[(c)] (2 marks)	What is the probability that the number of bits received in error does not exceed 12?
\end{itemize}

%\noindent(When answering, justify your answer with workings, or by reference to an axiom, theorem or rule.)

\subsection*{Part B : Binomial Distribution}
n=100, p=0.05
\begin{itemize}
\item from tables: $P(X=5) = P(X \geq 5) - P(X \geq 6) = 0.5640 - 0.3840 = 0.18$
\item from tables: $P(X \geq 10) = 0.0282$
\item from tables: $P(X \leq 12) = 1-P(X\geq 13) = 1- 0.0015 = 0.9985$
\end{itemize}
