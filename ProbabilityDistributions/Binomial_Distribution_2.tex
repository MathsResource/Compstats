Nine per cent of PCB boards purchased over the Internet from the Far East have some defect.  From a large consignment of boards, 50 are chosen at random.  What is the probability that:
5 or more boards have some defect?
Exactly 3 boards are defective?
Less than 2 boards are defective?
If more than 8 boards from the 50 were defective what action would you take? (justify)

In this question we are dealing with a binomial distribution and a successful outcome is finding a defective board

Therefore                 


(i)

5 or more boards have some defect

Look up the tables and find 


Probability of 5 or more boards being defective is 0.4723

(ii)

Exactly 3 boards are defective

Look up the tables and find 



Probability of Exactly 3  boards being defective is 0.1698

(iii)

Less than two boards

Look up the tables and find 



Probability of less than 2 boards being defective is 0.0532

(iv)

First we find the probability of getting more than 8 boards defective

Look up the tables and find 



Probability of more than 8 boards being defective is 0.0328

This would seem to indicate that there is aproximately a 3% chance of getting more than 8 defective boards. Normally we would not expect an event with a probability of less than 5% to occur. If we were to find more than 8 defective boards we would need to question the claim that the probability of finding a defective board is 9%.
