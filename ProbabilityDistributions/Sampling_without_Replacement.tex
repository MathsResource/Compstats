\item[(d)]  \textbf{\textit{Sampling without Replacement (4 Marks)}}\\
An urn contains 10 disks, 6 white and 4 red.  Two disks are selected, without replacement, from the urn.  Calculate the following probabilities:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  at least one disk is white;
\item[(b)]   exactly one disk chosen is white.
%\item[(c)]                 Neither disk chosen is red
%\item[(d)]              At most one disk chosen is red
\end{itemize}
 
 
 
 \subsection*{Part D : Sampling without replacement}

\begin{itemize}
\item P(At least one is white) = 1-P(neither is white)
\item $1- \left[(4/10)\times (3/9)\right]  = 78/90 = 0.8666$
\item P(Exactly one) - disjoint events
\item probability is sum of components
\item First is white $4/10 \times 6/9 =20/90$
\item Second is white $6/10 \times 4/9 =20/90 $also
\item P(Exactly One white )=40/90
\end{itemize}
