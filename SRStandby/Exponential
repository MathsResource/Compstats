\item[(c)] \textbf{\textit{Probability Distributions }}\\ On average, six people per hour use an electronic teller machine during the prime shopping hours in a department store. Therefore it is assumed that the expected time until the next customer will arrive will be 10 minutes. You may assume that the distributions of waiting times can be described by the exponential probability distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  What is the probability that at least 10 minutes will pass between the arrival of two customers?
\item[(b)]  What is the probability that after a customer leaves, another customer does not arrive for at least 20 minutes?
%\item[(c)]  What is the probability that a second customer arrives within 1 min after a first customer begins a banking transaction?
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Part C : Exponential Distribution}
Exponential Mean =10\\
Rate Parameter Lambda ($\lambda$) =1/10\\
Therefore $P(X \geq k ) = exp(-k/10)$
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(X \geq 10 ) = exp(-10/10) = exp(-1) = 0.3678$
\item $P(X \geq 10 ) = exp(-20/10) = exp(-2) = 0.1353$
\end{itemize}
