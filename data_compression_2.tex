\frametitle{Data compression(1)}
Data compression is the science (and art) of representing information in a compact form. Having been the domain of a relatively small group of engineers and scientists, it is now ubiquitous. \\ \bigskip It has been one of the critical enabling technologies for the on-going digital multimedia revolution for decades. Without compression techniques, none of the ever-growing Internet, digital TV, mobile communication or increasing video communication would have been practical developments. \\ \bigskip

Data compression is an active research area in computer science. By "compressing data", we actually mean deriving techniques or, more specifically, designing efficient algorithms to:

\begin{itemize}
\item represent data in a less redundant fashion
\item remove the redundancy in data
\item implement coding, including both encoding and decoding.
\end{itemize}

The key approaches of data compression can be summarized as modelling + coding.
Modelling is a process of constructing a knowledge system for
performing compression. Coding includes the design of the code and product of the compact data form.
